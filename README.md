Fantasy Draft Manager - Phase 2

How to Run my program: 
1. Compile the program: javac Rossman_Phase1.java
2. Run it: java Rossman_Phase1


Short summary/features:
This is the first part of my fantasy football draft manager project for class.  
Right now the program can compile and run in the console. It has a Player class, a DraftManager class, and a simple command loop that accepts input like "help" and "exit". The data loading and drafting features will be added in later phases.
Current progress:
- Player class finished
- DraftManager class skeleton created
- Command loop works
- Help and exit commands work

Next steps:
- Load actual player data from CSV files
- Implement "show" commands for each position
- Add drafting and crossing off players
